The writeup: I was able to implement everything on the rubric except for one thing. For some 
reason I was stuck on was letting the blank tile be any letter, I just used an underscore for now.

• (4) letter tiles in the player’s “hand” are selected randomly from a data structure with the proper
distribution of the letters (code!)
• (4) letter tiles can be dragged-and-dropped onto target Scrabble squares
• (4) program identifies which letter tile is dropped onto which Scrabble square
• (4) board includes at least two bonus squares
• (4) score is tallied correctly, including consideration of bonus square multipliers
• (3) any number of words can be played until the player wishes to quit or depletes all tiles
• (3) the board is cleared after each round so that a new word can be played
• (3) after playing a word, only the number of letter tiles needed to bring the player’s “hand” back
to 7 tiles are selected
• (3) score is kept for multiple words until the user restart a new game (implement next vs. restart)
• (2) Tiles can only be dragged from the “rack” to Scrabble board. If the user drop them anywhere
else, they will be bounced back to the “rack”.
• (2) Once the tile is placed on the Scrabble board, it can be moved back to the “rack”.
• (2) Except for the first letter, all sub-subsequent letters must be placed directly next to or below
another letter with no space. Else, they will bounce back to the “rack”.
• (2) user can always restart the game.
